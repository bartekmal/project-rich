# Contributing

1. Once you have the cloned repository, just do the following in the main folder:

`git checkout master`

`git pull`

`git checkout -b newBranch`

`git push --set-upstream origin newBranch`

2. Then you can normally add/commit/push to the new branch.

**Please get in touch before merging to master (for example bartosz.piotr.malecki@cern.ch).**
