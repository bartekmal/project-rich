See detailed documentation on the [LHCb core software](https://lhcb-core-doc.web.cern.ch/lhcb-core-doc/index.html). In case of manual building of the stack, useful information can be found in the [nightlies](https://lhcb-nightlies.web.cern.ch/nightly/) (current LHCb stack status) and in the individual project repositories - example [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhcb/Gauss) (links to documentation, details on the dependencies used in particular tags/releases).

Various ways of accessing/building the LHCb software are indicated below.
